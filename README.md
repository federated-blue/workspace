# Work towards federated Bluesky

This repo exists for recording thoughts and ideas so they don't get lost in the
Discord server logs. Everything here is not definitive - it's just a place for
writing down some notes while we're working out the details.

If you have commit access - feel free to create a subdir for your own stuff and
write there whatever you like. Files in the root dir should contain what we've
approximately reached the consensus on, but nothing here is set in stone -
anything can be changed. If you want to discuss a change, instead of just making
it - open a PR and start conversation on Discord.

That said, don't be a dick: respect others and don't try to hijack stuff. If it
turns out that this mode of operation is detrimental to constructive work - this
repo will get locked down and we'll look for alternatives.
